# EmberConf 2019 Broccoli Workshop

2 steps to get setup for the Broccoli.js workshop:

Clone this repo and run `yarn` or `npm install` before the workshop, or if you want the goods individually:

```bash
yarn add --dev broccoli \
    broccoli-cli \
    broccoli-asset-rev \
    broccoli-merge-trees \
    broccoli-funnel \
    broccoli-rollup \
    @babel/core \
    rollup-plugin-babel \
    rollup-plugin-commonjs \
    rollup-plugin-node-resolve \
    rollup-plugin-uglify@^3.0.0 \
    broccoli-sass-source-maps \
    broccoli-livereload \
    broccoli-clean-css \
    sass
```

or

```bash
npm install --save-dev broccoli \
    broccoli-cli \
    broccoli-asset-rev \
    broccoli-merge-trees \
    broccoli-funnel \
    broccoli-rollup \
    @babel/core \
    rollup-plugin-babel \
    rollup-plugin-commonjs \
    rollup-plugin-node-resolve \
    rollup-plugin-uglify@^3.0.0 \
    broccoli-sass-source-maps \
    broccoli-livereload \
    broccoli-clean-css \
    sass
```

It is also recommended that you install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as this repo has support for
interactive debugging, but don't worry, it's not mandatory, feel free to use whatever editor you're comfortable with.
If you intend to use debugging, you should also have Node version 8 or above.

That's it for now, looking forward to meeting everyone! üêπ
